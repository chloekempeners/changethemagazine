                    <p><span style="font-weight:700">At least, that’s what we, (graduated) art students, should believe if we listen to anyone else. It’s funny how our parents, friends, acquaintances or even people we don’t know, say that we have no future with our artistic aspirations. And why is that? Because people don’t seem to understand what an art-related job is. So they hide behind the most popular opinion. Luckily we, creatives, are used to discussing this subject.

                    <br />
                    Over the years it’s a well-known debate if you have a future in the arts. It’s often said that photography, cinematography, graphic design, illustration (and so much more) is only good for a hobby. While we certainly know better, let me elaborate for the people who don’t understand. Who do you think designs the magazine you’re reading right now? Who do you think directed your favourite movie? Who do you think shoots your business picture? Exactly, artistic people. Luckily people from other generations are getting their act together and accept the fact that an art-degree has value, even though you don’t necessarily need one.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The word ‘art’ on its own and out of context is quite pointless. ‘Art’ can be used to describe anything created or performed with intention. It can describe someone putting an object somewhere for others to see. Such as taping a banana up against the wall or placing an empty chair in the corner of a museum. What’s hard for public to understand, is that art isn’t something you immediately understand. Just as you can’t expect to understand Chinese if you open up a Chinese book for the first time. This is something that irritates the people, not understanding art. But if that’s something they find irritating, then let them be irritated. But take still life as an example, if you just look at the surface all you see are objects which are either natural (food, flowers, dead animals, plants, rocks, shells, etc.) or man-made things (drinking glasses, books, vases, jewellery, coins, pipes, etc.). It’s something you regularly see in art museums in different varieties. If an apple is included in the painting, it can signify for love, knowledge, wisdom, joy and death. In religious works it usually means temptation and original sin. The apple is also associated with a woman’s anatomy; breasts in particular. And then the core of the halved apple representing her sexuality or reproductive parts. A candle had also a lot of meanings. It can indicate the passing of time, faith in God (when it’s burning). When extinguished, it means death, the loss of virginity or the corruption of that matter. It can symbolize light in the darkness of a lonely individual or Christ. It’s purification/cleansing. But next to all that, take Rembrandt van Rijn his work as example as well. Rembrandt painted a lot of portraits because people couldn’t ‘randomly’ shoot a picture. Same as Vincent van Gogh who made beautiful paintings of the outside world. So it wasn’t just considered ‘art’, it’s also something they needed to do if they wanted to keep it as a memory.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Art is food for thought1. Every single person needs any form or type of art as relaxation. You can see art in your everyday life. You can see it when you’re on your way to work and an ad takes your attention, if you see a commercial before watching your favourite tv series or even if you just turn on the radio. But somehow when someone you know is involved with art it’s considered a ‘hobby’ and not a real job. I find that bullshit. Just because they don’t understand the field, doesn’t mean it’s not considered a real job. Look at Jimmy Nelson, he is a professional photographer who travels the world to photograph tribes. You can find his work in multiple art galleries, and I bet you at least know him from one picture. Or look at David Carson, considered one of the greatest graphic designers, most known for Ray Gun magazine. And he never even got an art-degree. Or to make it even more simple, Salvador Dali, was a brilliant painter whose paintings you can see all over the world. Are you going to tell me that all their work is still considered a hobby? That what they do is not considered a real job? I doubt it. As long as you, as a creative, have the right connections, the right attitude and are driven to show you work, then you’ll come a long way. We creatives have to believe in ourselves and need to keep fighting the debate, only that way, we will change people’s mind.

                    <p><span style="font-weight:700">David Carson is a graphic designer, art director and surfer. His work for the magazines beach culture and Ray Gun in the 1990s brought a new approach to type and page design breaking with traditional layout systems. He continues to explore the possibilities of graphic design, particularly typography as a form of expression across print and video for both commercial and cultural clients. Chloé Kempeners spoke to David about his work and influences.</span></p>
                    <div class="davidtit">
                    Q: Was there a specific reason why you started working analogue?</div>
                    <p>A: When I started there was only analogue, there was no choice to make. There was no computer, no screen. And now 90% of my work is done digitally on my screen. We had to start analogue because there was no other option. And now, like everybody, most of my work is done on the computer.</p>
                    <div class="davidtit">Q: Last week you actually showed us you ripped off pieces of posters in the streets. Is that something you do often?</div>
                    <p>A: Usually when I travel, if I see something interesting, I take it off the wall, ‘steal’ it or tear it off. Sometimes I make collages out of it. Or use it in a project if I find the need to.</p> 
                    <div class="davidtit">Q: When did you notice you have a talent for public speaking and giving lectures?</div> 
                    <p>A: There wasn’t any point I realized “Wow I’m good at this”. Most people didn’t like public speaking, but I have been doing it for over 20 years now. It’s kind of easy to focus on work and it’s different than just giving a speech. You can concentrate on what they’re looking at. It comes natural to me.</p> 
                    <div class="davidtit">Q: And when did you decided to continue to give lectures?</div>
                    <p>A: There is no actual schedule or program when I’m giving lectures. Sometimes I just get emails of people who ask if I want to give a lecture and if I get a free trip somewhere then that’s cool. It’s a little side thing, it’s not merely what I do. They’re fun, I get to see the world.</p> 
                    <div class="davidtit">Q: How do you call your own work?</div>
                    <p>A: Graphic Design. It’s only in the last years I decided playing with collages, it’s fun.</p>
                    <div class="davidtit">Q: What do you think about using grids? Because you are well known about not using grids.</div>
                    <p>A: You have to work with whatever works for you. If it works for you to use a grid, that’s fine. If it works for you to not use a grid, then that’s fine as well. They just don’t work for me, I think it’s kind of a cheat. I never learned them, and when I did, I didn’t see a reason to use them. But I do think it’s kind of cheating in a way; if you think a grid is going to give you a good design. If you can’t feel it and if you need a grid to do good work, then you’re probably in the wrong field. You’re probably going to get bored of it. Because anybody can throw in a grid, fill it and correct position and that’s going to get boring.</p>
                    <div class="davidtit">Q: You were talking about a ‘good design’. What is a good design in your eyes?</div>
                    <p>A: It’s hard to say, it has to feel right depending on what it’s trying to say and to the audiences. It has to feel right and then I consider it a good design. There is no formula. It’s a combination of how it feels, what it’s trying to say and the connection with the audience.</p>
                    <div class="davidtit">Q: Do you think it’s time to re-invent yourself?</div>  
                    <p>A: No, I think I’m still growing in doing what I do. I don’t have to force myself to re-invent myself. I’m still busy, I still enjoy what I do and I think it’s progressing. I don’t feel the need, like some designers to try to figure out a way to re-invent themselves. I’m getting more requests to speak and to make work. It’s the best as ever, maybe more.
